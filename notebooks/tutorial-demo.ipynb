    "## Problem description in a nutshell\n",
    "F likes to plan his holidays long in advance. Holidays are a scarce resource for him: he only has a limited yearly budget, and now he wants to make the most out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of F’s considerations:\n",
    "- He likes to have Fridays off\n",
    "- He needs to do his share of covering school vacations (obligation)\n",
    "- He likes to ski\n",
    "- He really needs a 2-week vacation to go somewhere warm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Being 2 days off? Not sufficient to rest\n",
    "- The longer he is off, the better he rests\n",
    "- More than 20 days in a row? Not even trying to get that approved\n",
    "\n",
    "... oh and let’s be opportunistic: weekends and holidays come for free\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be building a mathematical optimization model to help F plan his holidays, modelling some of the considerations above. We want\n",
    "- to maximize the utility of taking days off\n",
    "- to incentivize being off on specific days of the year, or on specific weekdays\n",
    "- longer periods as those provide more rest\n",
    "- at least one period with a minimum duration of 14 days\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook glues together the core steps and the building blocks of the optimization model. You can check the `src` folder for the `ModelConfig`  which defines the relevant parameters.\n"

    "_Disclaimer: the notebooks implement a particular modelling approach. This is only one out of a range of possible modelling approach, and is considered the easiest one to grasp the combined aspects of day-level attributes and period-level attributes._\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of defining the decision variables representing \"on which days to schedule a day off\", a period-level modelling approach is used. A **period** is characterized by the starting date $d$ and the duration of the period in days $l$. We can then represent some examples for the month of May 2024 in the visual below. Red squares represent public holidays.\n",
    "- (May 1, 2024; 5 days) in green require 2 days from the budget as May 1, 4 and 5 are either public holidays or weekends.\n",

    "- (May 9, 2024; 5 days) in orange requires 2 days from the budget\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these periods, the cost in terms of holiday units and value / utility - as sum of marginal day-level value and duration-level value - can be predetermined.\n",
